## Data
For this project, I analyzed data from the Safe Passage Study, also known as the PASS study. This is a multi-center, prospective pregnancy cohort study that collected data from women living in the Northern Plains, US and Cape Town, South Africa. Both populations are at high risk for drinking and smoking during pregnancy. The goal of the study was to investigate the role of prenatal drinking and smoking on postnatal outcomes.

It is important to identify the drinking/smoking patterns of women during pregnancy in order to better understand the risk of possible postnatal outcomes. Because of the dynamic behavior of the women's drinking and smoking habits, the first step was define the exposure variable by clustering the women based on their drinking and smoking patterns. I accomplished this through the use of k-means clustering. Next,
