I am an M.S Candidate in Biostatistics at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health with an interest in data science. I am experienced with hypothesis testing, ANOVA, regression models, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, and NLP to name a few. I enjoy mathematics and self-directed learning (#TeamMOOCS). Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or through email and visit my GitHub page for examples of my code.
