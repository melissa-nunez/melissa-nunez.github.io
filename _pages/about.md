### Currently I work as a Data scientist at the New York City Council where I collaborate with lawyers and policy analysts to conduct oversight of city agencies, influence policy making through statistical analysis, and incorporate data-driven approaches into bill drafting. I have a Master of Science degree in Biostatistics from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health with experience in hypothesis testing, regression models (linear, logistic, mixed effects), mapping, data visualization, clustering, and sentiment analysis to name a few. I enjoy applied mathematics and self-directed learning (#TeamMOOCS). Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or through email and visit my GitHub page for examples of my code.
