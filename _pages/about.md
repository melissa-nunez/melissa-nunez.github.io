#### I have a Master of Science degree in Biostatistics from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health with an interest in data science. I am experienced in hypothesis testing, regression models (linear, logistic, mixed effects), data visualization, clustering, mapping, and sentiment analysis to name a few. I enjoy applied mathematics and self-directed learning (#TeamMOOCS). Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or through email and visit my GitHub page for examples of my code.
